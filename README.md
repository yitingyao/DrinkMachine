A Java program that takes user input for drink size and volume, verifies if inputs are valid. Determines that if volume is outside of specified tolerance. 

A fast food company uses drink machines that serve three sizes, small (250ml), medium (400ml), and large (500ml).For quality control, the company samples the amount of beverage served by the machine based on the size selected
to see if the contents in the cup are within 10 ml of the expected serving size. Once the data is entered the program will report the size selected, the volume measured, and if the machine needs
maintenance or not.  The program should repeat this process until the user no longer needs to enter measurements.
Users can make mistakes, so the program should not crash if text is entered instead of numbers when expected, if an incorrect size is entered, or invalid volume e.g. negative number, this would be indicated as an error in the
report.
